# Curing Boredom
A Dynamic Web Application - Group Project

Created during Week 4 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp with 2 other group members. The challenge was to create a web application that constituted of a minimum of 2 APIs, using AJAX to pull data and a polished UI that utilizes Bootstrap. 

## Overview

Curing Boredom is an app that allows users to find restaurants and events in their area quickly and efficiently. It utilizes a clean, easy-to-use interface that makes finding places simple and fun. 

## Utilizing the App

* View the app: [Github Pages Project Link](https://nicolelcarvalho.github.io/Curing-Boredom-Group-Project/)

* Restaurants in NYC are displayed by default, just to give users a sense of how the app looks and works. 
* Type in a zip code or city/state to search results in a specific area.
* Filter search even further to find restaurants with certain cuisines or events in certain categories. 
* Users can also create a login to utilize a chat feature. This feature allows users to chat about places they currently are or get opinions from others on places they've been. 
* Users can also filter through the chat using keywords to see what people are saying about specific places they are interested in.
