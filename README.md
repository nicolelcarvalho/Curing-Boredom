# Curing Boredom - A Dynamic Web Application

Created during Week 4 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp with 2 other group members. The challenge was to create a web application that constituted of a minimum of 2 APIs, using AJAX to pull data and a polished UI that utilizes Bootstrap. 

Curing Boredom is an app that allows users to find restaurants and events in their area quickly and efficiently. It utilizes a clean, easy-to-use interface that makes finding places simple and fun. 

Users can search for restaurants or events by zip code or city/state. When the app loads, restaurants in NYC are displayed as a default, just to give the users a sense of how the app looks and works. They then are able to type in their own zip code or city/state to search results in their area. They are also able to filter their search even further to find restaurants with certain cuisines or events in certain categories. 

Users can also create a login to utilize a chat feature. This feature allows users to chat about places they currently are or get opinions from others on places they've been. Users can also filter through the chat using keywords to see what people are saying about specific places they are interested in.
